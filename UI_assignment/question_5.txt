If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you
will choose as your partner and why?

In my engineering class, I worked with a team of people. Almost all of my minor projects are completed in collaboration with my partner G. VibhuKumaran. I collaborated with him on every assignment from my first to third year. We both have some bonding while doing projects. So it is easy to complete and also easy to understand to each other.
